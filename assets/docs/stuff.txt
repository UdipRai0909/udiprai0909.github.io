The precise format of the comment depends on the language. For instance, for C-Style languages, regions are of the form:

/* #region Main */
public static void Main(string args[])
{
   //Your code goes here
}
/* #endregion */
For HTML style languages, you could define a foldable region with the following tags:

<!-- #region Body -->
<body>
</body>
<!-- #endregion -->
